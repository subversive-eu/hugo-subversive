## /about/

Example of using yousite.com/about/ with :  

- ShowToc: true
- hidemeta: true
- tocopen: true
- disableShare: true

The html of this page.md comes from /layouts/_default/single.html  

For this page, you can use type: myabouttype + url: "/about/" like archive.md.  
Html will come from /layouts/myabouttype/single.html  You have to make it and personnalize.

## /archives/

/archives/ come from /layouts/myarchivetype/single.html.  
So, it's become easier to css and personnalize.
